# Investing Basics

## Warren Buffet's Keys

- Before buying a stock, what is the company worth? Think of it as if it were a local small business.
- How much do I have to pay? Consider the Price/Earnings ratio (Lower if possible)
- Think in the mindset that buying one share is like buying all the shares of a company. Make sure you are investing in equity that you feel proud in.
- Evaluate the company's moat aka what its competitive advantages are in the market. The wider the moat the better.
