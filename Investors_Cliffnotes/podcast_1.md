# Investing Basics

## Warren Buffet's Keys

- Before buying a stock, what is the company worth? Think of it as if it were a local small business.
- How much do I have to pay? Consider the Price/Earnings ratio (Lower if possible)
- Think in the mindset that buying one share is like buying all the shares of a company. Make sure you are investing in equity that you feel proud in.
- Evaluate the company's moat aka what its competitive advantages are in the market. The wider the moat the better.

## Examples

- A local bookstore makes $10k in profit every year. You can buy the business for $100k. The P/E ratio is 10 on this firm. Essentially, in 10 years if the bookstore stays in business and maintains a consistent profit you will earn your investment back.
