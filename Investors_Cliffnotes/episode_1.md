## Objectives 
- The difference between value trading and value investing
- The difference between an asset and a liability

### Value investing vs Value Trading
Taking an example of the man who traded up items from a paperclip to a house, he slowly traded items for items with more value. This is value trading. 

Holding an asset throughout a trading period is value investing. Also, it is asset accumulation.

### Assets vs Liabilities
An asset provides future benefits. So an appartment complex would be a better example of an asset since it could pay out over future years.

A liability is something a person or company owes, usually a sum of money. Liabilities are settled over time through the transfer of economic benefits including money, goods, or services.

## Extra Information

### Warren Buffet's Keys
- Before buying a stock, what is the company worth? Think of it as if it were a local small business.
- How much do I have to pay? Consider the Price/Earnings ratio (Lower if possible)
- Think in the mindset that buying one share is like buying all the shares of a company. Make sure you are investing in equity that you feel proud in.
- Evaluate the company's moat aka what its competitive advantages are in the market. The wider the moat the better.

### Examples
- A local bookstore makes $10k in profit every year. You can buy the business for $100k. The P/E ratio is 10 on this firm. Essentially, in 10 years if the bookstore stays in business and maintains a consistent profit you will earn your investment back.
