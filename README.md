**Stock and company analyses for investing.**

Overview
------

Invest is a python application to help strategize a stock portfolio. For requirements, this application uses Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Yahoo-Finance.

Methodology
------

According to Warren Buffett, we should buy stocks in much the same way we would evaluate buying a business for acquisition in its entirety. We want the following factors when we are investing in a business:
1. It is a business that we can understand
2. The company has favorable long-term prospects
3. It is operated by honest and competent people
4. The stock is available at a very attractive price
